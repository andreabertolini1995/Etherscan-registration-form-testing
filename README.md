# Etherscan-registration-form-testing

[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) is a block explorer and analytics platform that allows users to access details on any Ethereum blockchain transactions that are pending or confirmed. As in most websites, Etherscan has a page dedicated to a [registration form](https://etherscan.io/register) to allow new users to sign up on the platform. 

The goal of this project is to create **test scenarios** for the registration form on Etherscan website, create **E2E browser tests** to cover all test scenarios and justify the choice of the tools that have been used for the automatic testing.
